WhatsApp UI & Feature Clone
This project represents a comprehensive and high-fidelity Flutter application, meticulously developed to replicate the core user interface and features of the popular WhatsApp chat platform. It was crafted as an independent technical assessment, demonstrating a deep understanding of production-quality mobile development and attention to detail.

The primary objective was to create a pixel-perfect, feature-rich application that not only mimics the aesthetic of WhatsApp but also implements its fundamental functionalities and adheres to modern architectural principles.

Core Features & Technical Highlights
Comprehensive Chat Functionality: Supports a robust messaging system, enabling users to send and receive text messages, share images and various file types, and engage in authentic voice message conversations.

Dynamic Storytelling: Includes a full-featured stories module, allowing users to view ephemeral content in the form of both image and video statuses.

Intuitive UI & Adaptive Theming: Features a user interface that faithfully reproduces WhatsApp's navigation patterns and AppBar design. The application seamlessly supports both light and dark modes to provide a comfortable viewing experience in any environment.

Multi-Language Support: Demonstrates strong localization capabilities by offering seamless support for both Arabic and English languages, ensuring a wider and more accessible user base.

Efficient Local Storage: Utilizes the Hive database for fast and reliable local data persistence. This ensures that chat history and user data are securely stored on the device, providing a smooth and responsive experience even when offline.



Scalable Architecture: The codebase is built upon a Clean Architecture foundation. This choice ensures the project is not only functional but also highly organized, modular, testable, and maintainable, making it easily scalable for future feature additions.

This project showcases an ability to transform design concepts into a tangible, professional-grade mobile application that meets strict quality and performance standards
